## About
The inverse kinematics problem is an age old problem which many mathematicians have tried to solve. There is no exact solution to this problem, but there are many approximations. Calculation of coordinates when you have a given length of a joint along with an angle is easy, but calculating the needed angle to maneuver this joint to a certain coordinate is not. 

CCD makes an approximation of how you need to rotate the joints of a robot arm to maneuver to a given point in space as quickly as possible. 

## Installation 
This program can simply be run by executing the ccd.py file, only dependencies are numpy and matplotlib
